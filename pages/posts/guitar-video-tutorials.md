# Learning Guitar from Primary Sources

Early on in quar, some [:music:]ians have taken to live streaming [:guitar:] lessons. I've
[:learn:]ed from [:Dirty Projector:]'s David Longstreth and [:Fleet Foxes:]' Robin Pecknold each document the broad ideas played in much of their newly released material. Both of their
songwriting styles include alternative guitar tunings and intricate picking patterns.
Crowd-sourced tab sites just can't nail this kind of music well. Most of the tabs are wrong in
subtle ways, are incorrectly in standard tuning, or using different chord voicings. Each of these
things and more can lead to disappointing results. I hope to see more lessons from primary sources.

I remember learning ["Temecula Sunrise"](https://youtu.be/8z5nFNIIsoI) by Dirty Projectors in
high school. It felt challenging and satisfying to practice. On their newest collection of EPs the
song ["Overlord"](https://youtu.be/LzHGYtIqLig) is a standout track. The tune is not too complex,
but has some odd chords (ex. Ebmaj7 in an alternative voicing) and has a capo on 1.

Fleet Foxes songs are often in non-standard tunings, mystifying any reverse engineering attempts
myself. I suppose some expert guitar players could more successfully get the songs right by ear.
In the video above, Robin speaks towards his melody writing process. The guitar chord plus the
vocals shift from dissonance to resolution through the phrase. Getting a deeper insight into the
music makes the listening experience more enjoyable. My favorite song on the new album is
["Thymia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5YfyrRHNM&ab_channel=FleetFoxes). I've played that
riff so many times. I'm thinking of getting a second hand guitar just to keep in that alternate
tuning. As you can see in the screenshot below, I like this album kind of a lot (and it doesn't
count the many times I've streamed on youtube).

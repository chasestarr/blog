# Uncanney Valley at the De Young

I stopped by an estate sale in the [:Haight:] this weekend. Finding it was by coincidence, but I was surprised
to learn that the homeowner was an artist. He had collected tons of organized newspaper clippings. I purchased
a small exhibition catalog of [:Willem de Kooning:] along with the New York Times article commemorating the
artist's death; a fitting memento considering the circumstances.

The [:De Young:] Museum opened the "Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI" exhibition this month. I've seen
actually good work at the De Young (DIS show & Nate Boyce performance) and clearly share some similar vibes with a
curator there. "[:AI:]" or "[:New Media:]" shows tend to be mundane and cater towards instagramable experiences.
Uncanney Valley shares some similarities but definitely has a couple stand-out artworks.

Upon entering the show you arrive at a brightly lit room to the right housing [:Ian Cheng:]'s "BOB (Bag of Beliefs)".
Cheng has been one of my favorite artist over the past decade. Ever since his early glitched-out mocap animations
in entropy wrangler I've been drawn to the distinctive Miyazaki like color and movement. Seeing the work in person
was finally a bucket-list item checked off but it's a bit tough to continue to feel captivated since I've spent many
hours watching the work online or staring at work-in-progress images. The work draws a large crowd and the AI
character successfully entertains with it's algorithmically generated actions. One of his quotes goes something like:
"a new technology is only as valuable as its ability to assault human dignity". While that sounds dark and forboding,
I think speaks towards the way in which innovation has the ability to change a viewer's beliefs or outlook on the
world.

The next room was a video work [:Christopher Kulendran Thomas:] and [:Annika Kuhlman:] called "Being Human". A
transparent is positioned in the center of the room, paintings hang of the walls, small sculptures sit on plinths
throughout the room. I found it odd to include these details since the room was dark. The video featured [:deep-fake:]
monologues from Taylor Swift and Oscar Murillo questioning what it means to be an individual in the time of [:artificial intelligence:].
What caught me off guard was how at some point the room quickly lit up and as a viewer you are confronted with the
previously out of place more-traditional [:art:].

After the two pieces described above I passed through [:Forensic Architecture:]'s installations. Their
[Triple Chaser](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/triple-chaser) project is fascinating. I'm always impressed
by their ability to reconstruct, an in this case "invent", 3d modeled scenes important to the work. The visual language
of [:machine learning:] is captivating.. colorful, attends to emergent properties in image/video, lively and active.

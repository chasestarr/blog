# Cel Genesis video release show

Christina and I went to see an industrial/hardcore show last night. The performances from
[:Cel Genesis:] and [:Dock Hellis:]
were great. ([Cel Genesis instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cel_genesis/), [Dock Hellis instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dock.hellis/)) Cel's got an intense high-tempo energy and fascinating ear for piercing mechanical sound. When first
learning about the group, I came across their set on soundcloud and was attracted to the upfront percussion mix.

The distinct visual perspective that them and other groups in the same [:Oakland:] hardcore scene put out caught my eye.
Their instagram contains a sincere mix of meme reference, anime, geometric abstraction, and classic event poster
composition with full lineup. I was hyped on the group and looked forward to checking them out live.

Dock Hellis came on with a wild stage setup where their tabletops were stacked on top of each other. One member stood
on a step facing the crowed and operated the equipment on the top bunk while another member playing guitar, back to the
crowd, manning the bottom bunk. The venue pumped out a ton of smoke with little light but quick pops of color to highlight
the tunes. This set was really good and engaging, but I can't seem to find recordings online. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` Below are some
photos from that set. I think next time I'll bring my film camera. There's something about the shared experience of low
visibility but close proximity and can be well summed up in an image.

Cel Genesis kicked off their set by playing a new [:music:] video. Some people in the venue held up a sheet in front of a
projector so we could all view. The videos got a medical/lab theme that's eerie and offsetting. The band name is
coincidentally shared with a shuttered [biotech startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cell-genesys). Maybe
related? Their performance was hectic and loud with many people in the crowd moshing. Bright white strobe lights quickly
stuttering causing a stop-motion effects. The live drums set the tone right and differentiates the group's sound from
comparable musicians. The closing track was a cover of Korn's "Freak on a Leash" (I think?). Recognizing the vocals was
tough due to the distorition but it seemed like that rhythm came through.
